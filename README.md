##Module 4 - React##

I made this task tracker with a reminder, where you can add and delete your tasks with a youtube tutorial and changed some styling afterwards but added no extra features due to absolutely no time for that.

I learned alot in this tutorial - f.ex. the components building in react which I really like and think that it makes the reading and writing of the code easier. Another thing I learned is that it's super complicated to get the live link to work for react if you don't fully understand what you are doing >.< Haha!

I started out trying to make a mock json backend to store the tasks but then it all went to shit and I spent a day and a half trying to fix it before I decided to start all over again. So your tasks will not save between refreshes and thats just how it has to be for now. 

I know it's hard to give feedback on tutorials but I hope that you belive me when I say that I learnt alot by watching this tutorial about 4-5 times and making/fixing all kinds of mistakes.
